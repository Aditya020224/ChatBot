# About this project ðŸš€
This ChatBot will understand you when you're greeting her. Like a "Hello", "Hi", "Hey", "Good morning", "Good day", ect. The same applies when writing valediction such as: "Bye", "Good bye", "Take Care", ect. It understands the game Rock-Paper-Scissors, curse words and you can even ask it, if it can tell a joke. You can also ask it for it's name and what it's favorite color is. If you're writing something that dosen't have an answer of it then ChaBot will return it with message as: "Try asking something else!". It was a chill project to make and API was not used for this ChatBot.
